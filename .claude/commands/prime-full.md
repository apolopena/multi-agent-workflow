description: Full prime with subagent-generated context
---

Read CLAUDE.md then dispatch Atlas agent for full context generation.

After Atlas completes, read all generated files:
- Read .ai/scratch/context-primer.md
- Read .ai/scratch/arch-primer.md
- Read recent entries from CHANGELOG.md

Then confirm you are primed with a summary of what you learned.
