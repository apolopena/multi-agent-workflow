description: Quick prime from existing context files
---

## Instructions
Read CLAUDE.md

1. **Read both files in parallel**: `.ai/scratch/arch-primer.md` and `.ai/scratch/context-primer.md`
   - If either file is missing, error and tell user to run `/prime-full` first
   - Also read recent entries from `CHANGELOG.md` if present
2. **Present 100-150 word synthesis** with emojis covering:
   - Architecture overview
   - Current work/branch status
   - Key patterns and workflows
   - Next steps
3. **End with**: "âœ… Primed and ready to work!"

**CRITICAL**: All steps MUST happen in ONE message. Read both files in parallel, then synthesize.
